Readme file.

Files:
	makefile		// turns the .tex into a .pdf
	faq4u.tex		// LaTeX file for the FAQ document
	README			// readme file
	README.md		// readme file in markdown

Instructions:
	'make' in terminal to build the .pdf document and also clean.
	'make faq4u' just builds the document, no cleaning.
	'make clean' to delete unnessesary files after the document is made.
	'make clean_all', like above but deletes .pdf document also.
	'make tar' puts source files into a tar ball.
